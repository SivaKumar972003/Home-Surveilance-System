A Home Surveillance System is a security setup designed to monitor and protect a residential property. It typically includes cameras, motion sensors, alarms, and remote access features. The system helps homeowners keep an eye on their property in real-time, record footage for future reference, and receive alerts in case of any suspicious activity.

Objectives

Enhance home security by monitoring indoor and outdoor areas.
Provide real-time surveillance through live streaming.
Record and store video footage for later review.
Enable remote access through mobile or web applications.
Detect motion and send alerts to the homeowner.
Integrate with smart home devices for automated security responses.

Components:

CCTV Cameras – IP or wireless cameras to capture video footage.
Motion Sensors – Detect movement and trigger alarms.
Alarms & Sirens – Alert homeowners and scare off intruders.
Cloud/Local Storage – Save recorded videos for review.
Mobile App/Website – Allows users to monitor footage remotely.
Night Vision & AI Detection (Optional) – Improve visibility and recognize humans vs. pets.

Working Principle:

Video Capture – Cameras continuously record or activate when motion is detected.
Data Transmission – Footage is transmitted via Wi-Fi or wired networks to a storage device or cloud service.
Remote Access – Users can view live streams or recorded videos through a smartphone app or web dashboard.
Alerts & Automation – Motion sensors trigger notifications and alarms, ensuring quick response to threats.
